Sure, there's some bad blood with his cousin and It needs time to adapt to his different perspective of running a kitchen, I got that. But at the same time he's like one of the best chefs of the world and there's no respect for him at all. That takes away from the dynamic of hating the change, but respecting the man, which makes It feel a bit one-dimensional to me. It's all very focused on the conflicts and overly dramatised which doesn't rhyme with the \"realistic\" approach.\n",
